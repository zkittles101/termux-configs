# termux-configs

A repository for config files for my termux instance, and also a starting point for my future configs on the desktop

## Notes:
- since some LSPs and formatters cannot be installed through `Mason`, i opted to use the ones available from the termux repository
> for now `stylua` and `lua_ls` are installed through the repo
